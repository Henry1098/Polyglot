fine words butter no parsnips
as one door closes, another opens
no time like the present
snitches get stitches and wind up in ditches
desperate times require desperate measures
nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people
there's none so blind as those who will not see
if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail
out of sight, out of mind
so far so good
no matter how thin you slice it, it's still boloney
tempus fugit
there's many a slip between the cup and the lip
the nail that sticks out gets hammered down
there is strength in numbers
leave with the one what brought ya
if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
work smarter, not harder
today is a good day to die
wanton kittens make sober cats
every Jack has his Jill
a contented mind is a perpetual feast
don't drop the soap
life is like a box of chocolates
a woman's work is never done
a miss is as good as a mile
give them an inch and they'll take a mile
you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
it ain't the whistle that pulls the train
to a hammer, everything looks like a nail
eat, drink and be merry
too many cooks spoil the soup
united we stand, divided we fall
go hard or go home
one should never meet one's heroes
great minds
dance with the one what brought you
you cannot put the same shoe on every foot
the truth is in the wine
even a blind pig can find an acorn once in a while
new brooms sweep clean
speech is silver, but silence is golden
you pays your nickel and you takes your chances
a bad workman always blames his tools
murder will out
knowing is half the battle
you don't look at the mantelpiece when you're poking the fire
every law has its loophole
feed a cold, starve a fever
devil is in the details
it ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
only Nixon can go to China
the bad penny always turns up
sow the wind and reap the whirlwind
if pigs had wings they would fly
there's no I in team
necessity knows no law
shoemaker, stick to your last
first catch your hare
you only live once
you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube
can't live with them, can't live without them
all that glisters is not gold
early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise
ignorance is bliss
leave with the one that brung you
stupid is as stupid does
the jug goes to the well until it breaks
proverbs should be writ in pairs
some days you get the bear, other days the bear gets you
a stick in a bundle is unbreakable
every cloud has a silver lining
make lemonade
proverbs should be sold in pairs
it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God
all or none
the fucking you get isn't worth the fucking you're going to get
success depends on your backbone, not your wishbone
dance with the one who brought you
union is strength
do unto others as you would have them do unto you
the first step is always the hardest
a sorrow shared is a sorrow halved
there's no accounting for taste
don't get mad, get even
business before pleasure
money talks, bullshit walks
squeaky wheel gets the grease
power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely
waste not, want not
misery loves company
there are no atheists in foxholes
the end justifies the means
timing is everything
bad news travels fast
beware of Greeks bearing gifts
a leopard cannot change its spots
too many cooks spoil the broth
it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye
the apple does not fall far from the stem
cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye
many hands make light work
every shut eye isn't asleep
no rose without a thorn
one can't break a twig in a bundle
buy when it snows, sell when it goes
if there's grass on the field, play ball
only fools and horses work
caveat lector
laugh before breakfast, cry before supper
garbage in, garbage out
race on Sunday, sell on Monday
where there's muck there's brass
half a loaf is better than no loaf
there are many ways to skin a cat
never change a running system
start from where you are
too much bed makes a dull head
you can't take it with you
when one door shuts, another one opens
you cannot break a twig in a bundle
throw enough mud at the wall and some of it will stick
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
handsome is that handsome does
like father like son
yesterday's gone
a camel is a horse made by committee
bet on the jockey, not the horse
even a blind squirrel finds an acorn every once in a while
rules is rules
when one door shuts, another door opens
it is a wise child that knows his own father
it takes a village to raise a child
a good beginning makes a good ending
one cannot break a stick in a bundle
snitches get stitches
it isn't over until the fat lady sings
you can't fix stupid
the devil we know is better than the devil we don't
don't dip your pen in company ink
justice delayed is justice denied
all's fair in love and war
nothing succeeds like success
a dumb priest never got a parish
don't cry over spilled milk
it's not what you know but who you know
in for a dime, in for a dollar
loss and gain are brothers twain
justice is blind
dance with the one what brung ya
God helps those who help themselves
if you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas
the cow knows not the worth of its tail till it loses it
the whistle doesn't pull the train
a penny saved is a penny gained
crime doesn't pay
never look a gift horse in the mouth
short reckonings make long friends
sell in May, then stay away
one swallow doesn't make a spring
if my sister had balls, she'd be my brother
the more things change, the more they stay the same
what's done cannot be undone
a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
a revolution is not a dinner party
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
do as I say, not as I do
one swallow doesn't a summer make
people who have, get
proverbs often come in pairs
where there's a will there's a way
too many chefs spoil the broth
if at first you don't succeed, try try again
a fault confessed is half redressed
everything old is new again
sell in May then go away
almost doesn't count
cannot live with them, cannot live without them
alpha fucks, beta bucks
one good turn deserves another
there are plenty of fish in the sea
unity is strength
forewarned, forearmed
people that live in glass houses should not throw stones
claw me, claw thee
a hit dog will holler
when in Rome, do as the Romans

the burnt child fears the fire
accidents will happen
zeal without knowledge is a runaway horse
the world is one's oyster

dance with the one that brought you
people who have, get more
money does not stink
sisters before misters
don't count your chickens before they're hatched
don't shit where you eat
hunt where the ducks are
if we had ham we could have ham and eggs, if we had eggs
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
well begun is half done
money talks
lightning never strikes twice in the same place
never judge a book by its cover
a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor
you can't break sticks in a bundle
dance with the one what brought ya
even a blind squirrel finds an acorn every now and then
a lie has no legs
only Nixon could go to China
to thine own self be true
the shoemaker's children go barefoot
two's company and three is none
give a man a fish
never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
you've got to crack a few eggs to make an omelette
one who hesitates is lost
no one is born a master
you cannot break sticks in a bundle
third time's a charm
one man's fish is another man's poison

brevity is the soul of wit
the dose makes the poison
it isn't over till the fat lady sings
when the cat's away
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
those that have, get more
pride goes before a fall
tomorrow never comes
nice guys finish last
in unity, there is strength
behind every great man is a great woman
big things come in small packages
all cats are gray in the dark
the screwing you get isn't worth the screwing you take
close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades
them what has, gets
behind every successful man there stands a woman
union makes strength
an army marches on its stomach
patience is a virtue
one swallow does not make a summer
physician, heal thyself
wherever you go, there you are
every man has his price
a little knowledge is a dangerous thing
out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
a stick in a bundle cannot be broken
